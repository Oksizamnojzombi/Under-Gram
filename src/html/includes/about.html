            Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the
            forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features
            friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their
            letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise,
            allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This
            makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
            humanist and serif types.
