                Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical
                skeleton and the forms are largely geometric.
                At the same time, the font features friendly
                and open curves. While some grotesks distort
                their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
                Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters
                to be settled into their natural width.
                This makes for a more natural reading rhythm
                more commonly found in humanist and serif types.
